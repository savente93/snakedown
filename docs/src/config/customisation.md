# Customisation

You likely already know how to customise things in your favourite static site generator. Therefore our aim has been that the customisation should happen there. If you set up your [config](options.md) correctly then you should need to do anything with snakedown for customisation.

Here we will however give an overview of the things we generate so that you can customise them in your ssg so that you know where to look. You may additionally want to consult the documentation of the theme itself. For now this is quite sparse, but we do tend to add to this as we develop features!
