# Installation

## `cargo`

Currently the only place where snakedown is distributed to is `crates.io`. Other places might be considered later, but for how the easiest way to install it is by using `cargo install` like so:

```bash
cargo install snakedown
```

This will install the latest released version.

If you want to install the latest dev version you can also do that:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/savente93/snakedown --branch main --locked
```
